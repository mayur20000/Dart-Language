Flutter's GridView Widget: Building Scrollable Grids
The GridView widget in Flutter is used to display a scrollable,
 2D array of widgets. Unlike Row and Column which arrange widgets
  in a single linear direction, GridView allows you to lay out
  widgets in both horizontal and vertical directions simultaneously,
  creating a grid-like pattern.

It's commonly used for:
Photo galleries: Displaying a collection of images.
Product catalogs: Showing items in an e-commerce app.
Dashboards: Arranging interactive tiles.
Any scenario where you need a scrollable grid of identical or similar items.

Basic GridView Structures (Constructors)
GridView offers several constructors to help you build your grids:

GridView() (Default Constructor): Takes a SliverGridDelegate to control the layout. This is the most flexible but requires you to provide the delegate explicitly.

Common Delegates:

SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount: Creates a grid with a fixed number of tiles in the cross axis (e.g., always 2 columns).

SliverGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent: Creates a grid with tiles that have a maximum cross-axis extent (e.g., maximum width for each tile).

GridView.builder(): The most efficient way to build a GridView with a large (or infinite) number of items. It builds items lazily (only when they are visible), similar to ListView.builder().

GridView.count(): A convenient shortcut constructor that creates a grid with a fixed number of tiles in the cross axis (using SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount internally). This is often the easiest to start with.

GridView.extent(): A convenient shortcut constructor that creates a grid with tiles that have a maximum cross-axis extent (using SliverGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent internally). This is useful when you want tiles to adjust their size based on screen width.
